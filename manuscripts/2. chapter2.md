# 第二章—基礎數據結構

在這章，我們探討幾個實用的 Python 數據結構使用小貼士。包括：

- 使用 List & Turple
- 使用 String

## List & Tuple

在這個例子中，我們嘗試載入另一個模組 random。

```
from random import randint, choice

quotes = (
    "I want to put a ding in the universe.—Steve Jobs",
    "Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.—Charles R. Swindoll",
    "Family is not an important thing. It's everything.—Michael J. Fox",
    "Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!—Audrey Hepburn",
    "There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.—Edith Wharton",
    "Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.—Maya Angelou",
    "Be brave enough to live life creatively. The creative place where no one else has ever been.—Alan Alda",
    "The secret of getting ahead is getting started.—Mark Twain",
)


count = len(quotes)
random_index = randint( 0, count-1 )
print( quotes[random_index] )
```

# or

```
print( quotes[randint(0,len(quotes)-1)] )
```

# or

```
print( choice(quotes) )
```

String & Split

```
from random import choice

quotes = (
    "I want to put a ding in the universe.—Steve Jobs",
    "Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.—Charles R. Swindoll",
    "Family is not an important thing. It's everything.—Michael J. Fox",
    "Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!—Audrey Hepburn",
    "There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.—Edith Wharton",
    "Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.—Maya Angelou",
    "Be brave enough to live life creatively. The creative place where no one else has ever been.—Alan Alda",
    "The secret of getting ahead is getting started.—Mark Twain",
)

quote = choice(quotes).split("—")

print(f'“{quote[0]}” — {quote[1]}')
```

Nested Tuple

```
from random import randint

quotes = (
            ("I want to put a ding in the universe.", "Steve Jobs"),
            ("Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.", "Charles R. Swindoll"),
            ("Family is not an important thing. It's everything.", "Michael J. Fox"),
            ("Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!", "Audrey Hepburn"),
            ("There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.", "Edith Wharton"),
            ("Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.", "Maya Angelou"),
            ("Be brave enough to live life creatively. The creative place where no one else has ever been.", "Alan Alda"),
            ("The secret of getting ahead is getting started.", "Mark Twain"),
        )

quote = quotes[randint(0,len(quotes)-1)]

print("“" + quote[0] + "” — " + quote[1])
```

Dictionary
再改進一下

```
from random import choice

quotes = (
    {"quote":"I want to put a ding in the universe.", "source":"Steve Jobs"},
    {"quote":"Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.", "source":"Charles R. Swindoll"},
    {"quote":"Family is not an important thing. It's everything.", "source":"Michael J. Fox"},
    {"quote":"Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!", "source":"Audrey Hepburn"},
    {"quote":"There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.", "source":"Edith Wharton"},
    {"quote":"Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.", "source":"Maya Angelou"},
    {"quote":"Be brave enough to live life creatively. The creative place where no one else has ever been.", "source":"Alan Alda"},
    {"quote":"The secret of getting ahead is getting started.", "source":"Mark Twain"},
)

quote = choice(quotes)
content = quote["quote"]
source = quote["source"]

print(f'“{content}” — {source}')
```

使用 namedtuple：

```
from random import choice
from collections import namedtuple

Quote = namedtuple("Quote", "quote, source")

quotes = (
    Quote(quote="I want to put a ding in the universe.", source="Steve Jobs"),
    Quote(quote="Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.", source="Charles R. Swindoll"),
    Quote(quote="Family is not an important thing. It's everything.", source="Michael J. Fox"),
    Quote(quote="Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!", source="Audrey Hepburn"),
    Quote(quote="There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.", source="Edith Wharton"),
    Quote(quote="Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.", source="Maya Angelou"),
    Quote(quote="Be brave enough to live life creatively. The creative place where no one else has ever been.", source="Alan Alda"),
    Quote(quote="The secret of getting ahead is getting started.", source="Mark Twain"),
)

quote = choice(quotes)
print(f'“{quote.quote}” — {quote.source}')
```

使用 Lambda
Lambda 是一行的短函數，例如若果有以下代碼

```
def square(x):
    return x**2
```

由於得一行，我們可以簡化為：

```
lambda x: x**2
```

然而，這樣的函數定義沒有了名稱，所以如果我們需要給它一個名字，可以將這個函數賦值至一個變量：

```
square = lambda x: x**2
```

## Map

Lambda 的當見用途，是將函數作為參數使用。例如，我們可以使用 map 來將一個 List 內的內容快速運算得出新的值。

```
example_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
square = lambda x: x**2
list( map( square, example_list ))
```

## Range
在 Python 中，如果我們要建立一系列數字，可以定義一個 List，例如 [1,2,3,4,5] 就是一個連續 5 個數字的列表。那麼如果我們要建立一千個甚至一萬個的順序數字，豈不是要打好長？不用，因為我們有 range：
range(1,5)
